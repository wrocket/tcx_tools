# TCX Tools
## Motivation
I use an older Garmin Forerunner GPS watch to record various outdoor adventures. While I like the hardware very much, the related software tools leave a bit to be desired in regards to reliability.

These are a few little software tools I've written to help me manage my data, generally in the TCX file format. I've only tested them on the output of my Forerunner 305, so your mileage will most certainly vary on your device.

## [split_tcx.groovy](split_tcx.groovy)
This little Groovy script splits TCX files composed of several activities into individual activities, keeping all other markup intact. The software I use to export data from my watch to my computer slurps all the activity data as a single, giant TCX file. I usually only need to import the last activity file into Strava (or other platforms), thus this script.

### Example: Split a large file into individual activities
 
    $ groovy split_tcx.groovy some_large_file.tcx 
    Reading some_large_file.tcx...
    Found 12 activites.

	Done.

### Example: Extract only the most recent activity

    $ groovy split_tcx.groovy some_large_file.tcx --onlylast
    Reading some_large_file.tcx...
    Found 12 activites.

    Done.
